# Maze Solver

## What is this project?

This project is a fun computer program that creates and solves mazes. It's like having a digital mouse that can find its way through any maze we draw!

## Why did we make this?

We wanted to:

1. Learn how to make simple picture-based programs
2. Practice solving tricky problems step-by-step
3. Create something fun and visual to show off our coding skills

## What you need to run this

- A program to write code (we like VS Code, but use what you're comfortable with)
- A way to type commands to your computer (called a "command line")
- Python 3 installed on your computer

## What we've done

### 1. Set up the basics

We made sure everyone can use a special tool called Tkinter. It's what helps us draw pictures on the screen.

Why? Because we need to show our maze and how it gets solved!

### 2. Created a window to draw in

We made a "Window" class that opens up a blank space on your screen.

Why? This is where we'll draw our maze and show how it gets solved.

### 3. Drew some lines

We created "Point" and "Line" classes to help us draw lines easily.

Why? Mazes are made of lines, so we need an easy way to draw them!

### 4. Made maze cells

We created a "Cell" class. Each cell is like a little room in our maze.

Why? By thinking of the maze as lots of little rooms, it's easier to create and solve.

### 5. Built the whole maze

We made a "Maze" class that puts all the cells together.

Why? We need a way to manage all the cells and create a full maze.

### 6. Added some tests

We wrote some checks (called "unit tests") to make sure our code works correctly.

Why? This helps us catch mistakes and makes sure everything works as it should.

### 7. Created the maze puzzle

We added ways to knock down walls between cells to create the actual maze puzzle.

Why? A maze with no paths would be impossible to solve!

### 8. Solved the maze

We wrote a smart method that can find its way through the maze we created.

Why? This is the fun part - watching the computer solve the puzzle!

## How to use it

1. Make sure Python 3 and Tkinter are installed on your computer
2. Download or copy our code files
3. Open your command line
4. Run the program by typing: `python main.py`
5. Watch as the maze is created and solved before your eyes!
